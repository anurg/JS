### Angela YU Udemy Course - HTML Notes

HTML- HyperText Markup Language

HyperText means text linking to other text (pages)
Markup- is like special symbols around text which gives the text special appearance

### Headings
```
<h1> <h2> to ... <h6>
```

### Difference between Element & Tags
```
Element -  <h1> Welcome </h1>
Opening Tag- <h1>
Closing Tag - </h1>
```
### A page should generally have a single <h1> element that describes the content of the page (similar to the document's <title> element).

```
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>
```

### Usage notes
1. Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for a document automatically.
2. Do not use heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the CSS font-size property.
3. Do not skip heading levels: always start from <h1>, followed by <h2> and so on.

<p> Write your paragraph here. </p>
```
