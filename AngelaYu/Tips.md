### Tips from Angela

1. Watch the Videos for 10 minutes and Don't type the code (No Code Along). While watching videos, just try to understnd. After that you can try to write code to replicate, may be without help first.
2. For typing speed, you can use http://www.keybr.com 
3. Try to make Notes for yourself. One example is cornell note taking format. It has 4 sections- Topic, Keywords, Notes & Summary.
4. Change playback speed as per your comfort, fast if you know the topic and slow if its new or difficult.
5. Don't Skip any topics if they are not marked so.
6. Bookmark difficult topics where you struggle and first try the 10 minutes technique otherwise comeback to it later to tackle it again. Mark it for review.
7. Practice = Mastery
8. When stuck, use google, stackoverflow.Struggle is good for learning.
