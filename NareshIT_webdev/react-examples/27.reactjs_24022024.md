### Reactjs notes for 23rd Februray 2024

## useReducer

- It is used to configure a predictable state.
- It uses "Single-Source-of-Truth" mechanism, which predicts the changes and track the changes in data.
- It is easy for developer to maintain a centralized data store which is predictable.
- "useReducer()" hook provides a compact predictable store.
- Developers use "Redux" as predictable store for applications, which is a library for JavaScript based applications.
- "useReducer()" can configure a centralized store, which is accessible to any component across multiple requests.
- Components of useReducer are:

```
            a) Store
            b) State
            c) UI
            d) Reducer
```
- Store is the location where you can keep centralized data.
- State is the local state of a component that transports data from store to UI.
- UI represents View that can display the data and handle interactions with data.
- React requires "Actions" configured for data interactions so that it can manage 2 way binding.
- Reducer is responsible for tracking the Actions and Payload.
- Payload is the data delivered to Store.

1. Configure a centralized store
```
        let  initialState = { CartCount: 0 };
```
2. Configure reducer, which is a function that handles  "actions & state"
```
        function  reducer(state, action)
        {
            // action type & state to update
        }
       
        function  reducer(state, action)
        {
               switch(action.type)
               {
              case "addToCart":
              return { CartCount: state.CartCount + 1 };
             case "deleteFromCart":
              return { CartCount: state.CartCount - 1 };
            }
        }
   ```
3. Every component can use the reducer function with actions & state by using the hook
```       
            "useReducer()"

         const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

     dispatch({type: "addTocart"})
     dispatch({type: "deleteFromCart"})

    { state.CartCount }

```

Ex:

```
import { useReducer } from "react";

let initialState = {CartCount: 0}

function reducer(state, action){
    switch(action.type){
         case "add":
         return { CartCount: state.CartCount + 1 };
         case "remove":
         return { CartCount: state.CartCount - 1 }
    }
}

export function ReducerDemo(){

    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    function handleAddClick(){
        dispatch({type:'add'});
    }
    function handleRemoveClick(){
        dispatch({type:'remove'});
    }

    return(
        <div className="container-fluid">
            <h3>Shopping</h3>
            <button onClick={handleAddClick} className="btn btn-primary me-4 bi bi-cart4 position-relative"> <span className="bg-danger position-absolute badge rounded-circle"> {state.CartCount} </span> </button>
            <button onClick={handleRemoveClick} className="btn btn-danger bi bi-trash-fill"></button>
        </div>
    )
}
```
