### 14. Pattern

Pattern is used to verify the format of the input value.
Patterns are build by using regular expression.
Reular expression returns a format.
Regular expression is built by using "Meta Characters" & "Quantifiers".

Meta CHaracters
? -- 0 or 1 character
+ -- 1 or more character
* -- 0 or more character
. (dot)  -- any single character
\ is an escape sequence character. It can transform a Meta character as Normal character & vice-versa.
| [Pipe] refers to logical OR

() used for union
[]  used for range or multiple
^  - Exclude specified characters & allow others
\^  - starts with
$ - ends with
\d - refers to single digit number
\D - Non-numeric characters
\w - refers to single word characters which include "A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _"
\W - refers to all characters other than "A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _"  (Special Characters)
\s - It configures blank space.
\i - It ignores Capitalization [ not case sensitive]
Quantifiers

{ n}  - Exactlt n number of characters.
{n,m} - Minimum n & Maximum m
{n,} - Minimum n & Maximum any
