### Tables in HTML

HTML Tables

- Tables are used in HTML to design data grids.
- A data grid can display data arranged in rows and columns.
- Grid is mostly used for presentation and manipulation of data.
  [filter, sort, search, edit, insert, update, delete etc..]
- HTML 5 provides various elements for designing tables

```
    <table>              It configures a container with groups for head,body & footer.
    <caption>          It makes table SEO friendly
    <colgroup>          It can group a set of columns to highlight.
    <thead>              It is header section
    <tbody>              It is the body section
    <tfoot>              It is the footer section
    <tr>                  It is table row
    <th>                  It is heading format cell
    <td>                  It is normal table cell [table data]
```

Table Attributes:

1.  Frame, Rules & Border

    frame : It sets a frame for table, which includes the values:
    box, rhs, lhs, above, below & void

                 <table  frame="box | rhs | lhs..">

    rules : It is for rows, columns and groups in table.

                 <table rules="all | rows | cols | groups | none">

    border : It is for cells in table. It can have value 0=no-border, 1=border
    0 = false
    1 = true

                   <table  border="1">

Note: You can't configure border for table if rules are defined. You have to remove rule attribute for table inorder to set border. If both rules & border are defined, then rules are applied to table.

Syntax:

<table border="1" frame="void">
<table rules="all"  frame="box">
<table rules="rows" frame="void">
<table rules="all" border="1"> => only rules will apply

2. Cellspacing and Cellpadding

   cellspacing : It sets space between cells in table
   cellpadding : It sets space between cell content and border.

Syntax:

<table border="1" frame="void" cellspacing="5"  cellpadding="10">

3. BgColor and Background

   bgcolor : It sets background color for table, group, row or cell.
   background : It sets background image for table, group, row or cell.

Syntax:

<table bgcolor="yellow">
<thead bgcolor="yellow">
<tr bgcolor="yellow">
<td bgcolor="yellow">

    <table background="public/images/cricket.jpg">
    <tbody background="public/images/cricket.jpg">
    <td background="public/images/cricket.jpg">

4. width and height

   - You can configure width only for "<th> or <td>".
   - You can configure height for <tr> or <td>.

Note: <table> element provides "width" as property but not "height".

FAQ: What is difference between attribute & property?
Ans : Attribute is immutable, It can't change dynamically.
Property is mutable, It can change dynamically.

      Table width is available as both attribute and property.
      Table height is available only as attribute.

Syntax:

<table width="500">
<th width="200">
<td width="200">

Note: Always configure height for "<tr>"

Syntax:

<tr height="100">
<td height="100">

5. Align & Valign

   align : Horizontal alignment for table contents, left, center, right or justify.
   valign : Vertical alignment for table contents, top, center, bottom

Syntax:

<tr align="center">
<td align="center">
<tr valign="bottom">
<td valign="top">

6.  Colspan & Rowspan

        colspan        : It can merge multiple cells in a column into single cell
        rowspan        : It can merge multiple cells in a row into single cell
