### Class Notes 20th October 2023

If we want to keep the content in the browser memory than it should be put in head section.
If it needs to be delivered directly to browser than keep it in body.

### Styles in HTML

Styles

- Styles are additional attributes defined for HTML elements to make them more interactive and responsive.

- Styles are defined for HTML elements in 3 ways

    a) Inline Styles
    b) Embedded Styles
    c) External Style Sheets [CSS]


                             Inline Styles
- Inline is a technique where styles are defined for every element individually by using "style" attribute.

    <h1  style="attribute:value; attribute:value;...">  </h1>

- Inline styles are faster in rendering.
- However you can't reuse the styles.

Ex:
    <h1  style="background-color:yellow; color:red; text-align:center">

         HTML

    </h1>


                         Embedded Styles
                         ------------------------

- Styles are defined for elements using a <style> container.
- You can embed the style container in <head> or <body>.
- You can reuse the styles for various elements in page.
- However they are slow in rendering when compared to inline styles.
- You can't reuse across pages.
```
Syntax:
    <head>
        <style>
           selector
           {
            attribute: value;
            attribute: value;
           }
        </style>
    </head>
```
FAQ's:
1. Where to embed the <style> container? Head or Body?
A. You can embed in both <head> and <body> sections.
     Styles in <head> are intended to load into memory and accessed later when ever required.
     Styles in <body> are intended to load at the time of loading page.

2. If we define same attribute for element in both head and body which set of effects will apply?
A.
    If different attributes are configured in head and body then all will apply.
    If same attributes are defined then the recent is applied.


Note: Styles can be defined outside HTML scope, so that they can render faster.
      Howevery it is not a recommended practice for development.

3. What is MIME type defined for styles?
A.  MIME is "Multiple Purpose Internet Mail Extention".
     It is the type defined for content.
     Browser can understand content type only by using MIME type.
     Styles MIME is "text/css".

Syntax:
    <style type="text/css">

    </style>

4.  Is it neccessary to define MIME type for <link> element, while linking stylesheet?
A.  No. Link already have "rel" attribute, which refers to MIME.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_module/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css">


5. What is style media type?
A. It defines content for various media devices, which includes
      - screen
      - print
      - speech
      - all

   Syntax:
